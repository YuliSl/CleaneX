# CleaneX
This repository accompanies the ICLR paper "Predicting Classification Accuracy When Adding New Unobserved Classes" (Slavutsky & Benjamini, 2021).

The notebook `CleaneX.ipynb` demonstrates the proposed CleaneX method on both custom synthetic data and the CIFAR-100 dataset (already included in TensorFlow).

The file `data.py` is used by the notebook to generate data and classification scores.
